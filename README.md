# ScratchSART
An attention span test for Scratch.

# Instructions
Numbers will appear on the screen. When the X appears, press the space bar if the number is not 3. If the number is 3, do not press the space bar. The test will end when you make five mistakes.

# Why this test?
This is a modified version of the Sustained Attention Response Time (SART) test. Psychologists have approved the SART test because it is an effective way of measuring attention span. Other attention spans on Scratch are just timers that count up.
